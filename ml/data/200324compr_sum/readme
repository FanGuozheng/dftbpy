optimze compression radius (x), initial r: 3.34
target, gap (y)
data from symmetric CH4 (0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 experimental C-H bond length)
use simple mixing (sim) and anderson mixing (and)
learning rate, in group meeting 2020 figures folder, 5_5 means 5e-5
100 loop: loops are 100
nonsym_CH4: non symmetric CH4, which is ../CH4_data2, otherwise is symmetric CH4, ../CH4_data
